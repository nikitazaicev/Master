OTHER
Line graph convert takes longest time


TESTING
Handmade simple validation examples + validation on MNIST / HB
Testing with MNIST dataset

IMPROVEMENTS

1. bare bones
2. class weights -> all or nothing
3. optimizer learning rate, network depth and width, 
4. skip connections
5. extra features

RESULTS ON ONE DATAEXAMPLE
1. 50-60% of OPT
2 After adding features:
  deg / weight diff / max / relative diff ->
  -> 75% / 85% / 90% / 91%
  one by one
  -> 15% / 15% / 10% / 15%


EXPLORING
most graphs from suitsparse have opt-greed-diff 0.8-0.95

managed to beat some of the suitesparse examples that were found, with line graph
