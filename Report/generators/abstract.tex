\noindent In this work we tried to train a graph neural network model to solve the Maximum Weighted Matching problem on graphs using supervised learning and graph neural networks. Unfortunately, the final results were below the set expectations. The model seemed to be slightly worse than a standard greedy algorithm, mainly because greedy algorithm on average performed very well compared to the optimal solution. However, the neural network did show potential at solving specific gaphs that abuse the way greedy algorithm works. The results also do not imply that graph neural networks in general cannot beat greedy algorithm, but rather suggest that different approach or further improvement are needed.
