\chapter{Approach}

This chapter focuses on describing which approaches were chosen for the task at hand and why. 

To reiterate the current problem is to find out if \gls{gnn} can compete at solving the \gls{mwm} compared to other options such as greedy algorithm.

\section{Line graph approach}

Line graph approach was the first attempt at using a simple \gls{gnn}, which later turned out to be too time consuming for larger graphs to be worth further expriements. It did however give some usefull insight as well as a showed to be a proof of concept. 

\section{Edge prediction approach}

\section{Result Validation}
