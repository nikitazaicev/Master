trained on a 1000 graphs for now

RESULTS ON ONE DATAEXAMPLE MNIST
1. 0.55 of OPT
2 After adding features:
  one by one
  -> 0.15 / 0.14 / 0.5 / 0.12
  deg / weight diff / max / relative diff ->
  -> 0.75 / 0.85 / 0.91 / 0.92


Line graph vs normal vs normal with features (compared to standard greedy)

MNIST:
0.92 vs  0.77 vs  0.88 
Normal greedy remainder
LOW vs LOW vs LOW 

GOOD CASE data/Pajek/GD98b/GD98b.mtx:
1.43 vs  0.00 vs 1.00
Normal greedy remainder
LOW vs LOW vs LOW



NOT line NN graph MNIST weights normalized vs MNIST weights ones vs MNIST weights 1-2 vs MNIST weights 1-5
0.88 vs 1.00  vs 0.83 vs 0.60
